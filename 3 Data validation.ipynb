My disputes for each account to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit reporting agencies as well as attempts to resolve directly with the creditors have failed. Each agency and creditor refuse to correct the information and cite that it is \\\" accurate \\'\\'. These accounts were not charged off prior to my bankruptcy. They began reporting a charge off after my bankruptcy. This results in each of the accounts being identified as derogatory with a charge off after my bankruptcy. This is a significant factor for lenders who review my credit report because they see accounts \\\" charged off \\'\\' after bankruptcy which is misleading as to my credit worthiness. It is my understanding that the creditors may charge off an account after bankruptcy for their internal accounting purpose, but reporting a charge off after bankruptcy is a violation of credit reporting and bankruptcy statutes. I have sent correspondence multiple times, return receipt requested, with specific information that should be corrected. It remains in error and at this point they refuse to further investigate despite my repeated attempts. The credit agencies and creditors have also ignored my requests to provide their methods of verification after my disputes under the FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ; it is my position that neither are unable to provide a method of verification because they are unable to do so. I have repeated the process of dispute when these charge off were reported after bankruptcy for each creditor that is reporting a charge off. Some are not only reporting a charge off after bankruptcy, they changed payment history to reflect a charge off prior to bankruptcy which is untrue. Prior credit reports show that the accounts were not charge off prior to bankruptcy. The credits retroactively changed payment history to charge off after bankruptcy. The creditors who are engaging in these actions XXXX. For example, all of these creditors are reporting that the account was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX -- -after bankruptcy. XXXX specifically retroactively entered charge offs prior to bankruptcy when accounts were not in charge off status.  \"\n",

In the state of Texas, debt collection means an action, conduct, or practice in collecting, or in soliciting for collection, consumer debts that are due or alleged to be due a creditor. In addition debt collector means a person who directly or indirectly engages in debt collection and includes a person who sells or offers to sell forms represented to be a collection system, device, or scheme intended to be used to collect consumer debts. Therefore, I feel that they should respond to my request of validation for a debt they are claiming I owe.  \"\n",

It appears to us that the firm has done nothing which has injured you. Understanding our position requires some understanding of a complicated and, in some ways confusing set of laws relating to the bankruptcy and the real estate which you own. Your state has an exemption for a certain amount of equity in real estate. That is to say in a bankruptcy the creditors can not sell your residence to satisfy their judgment if you have less equity in the home than the amount of the exemption. The bankruptcy court can only order a creditor whose judgment has matured into a lien on your property to release that lien if you have equity in the real estate and that equity is less than the amount of the exemption provided under your state \\'s laws.  The problem here is that at the time of your bankruptcy you had no equity in the house. That is to say the amount of the mortgage was equal to or greater than the fair market value of the home. Under those circumstances the court can not enter an order to avoid the lien of the judgment. There was nothing that could have been done to get the court to do that. We attach hereto a copy of the Court \\'s opinion on our motion to avoid the lien which states what I have just told you.  While there was n\\'t a motion filed during your bankruptcy to avoid the lien, the Court has made it clear that it would have denied such a motion in any event. This does n\\'t mean that you still owe the money to that creditor. You do n\\'t! The judgment and the debt are discharged. The creditor can not take any action against you to collect the debt or enforce the lien. You should be able to refinance your mortgage without worry merely by showing the lender that you received a discharge in bankruptcy.  I hope this is helpful and that you will be able to fulfill your economic plans in the future.  \"\n",

Based on my understanding of the letter, it looks like Experian is refusing to complete my request because they do n\\'t think I wrote my dispute letter.  I would like Experian to know that I did in-fact send them a letter disputing information on my credit report. I also give Experian my full consent to continue with the investigation of my accounts per the dispute letter I wrote to them.  I researched a dispute letter online and just used that to manifest my dispute. Although I carefully reviewed Experian \\'s website to figure out exactly what I needed to do to file a dispute, I suppose it is possible that I may have missed something. I would truly appreciate Experian providing me with an explanation of my rights specifically pertaining to how I am allowed to dispute information on my credit report.  I need to know what made my letter \\\" suspicious \\'\\' and why Experian would think that someone else would want to have my credit report investigated. Does n\\'t investigating my credit only really benefit me?  I would like Experian to let me know if I can re-write my letter and if Experian could provide me with an example of a letter that would be acceptable to them since the one I wrote is not good enough.  I work very hard all day and can not afford to take time off to dispute my accounts. I also do not have the money to be represented by an attorney or any other agency. Would completing a dispute over the phone provide me with the same benefits as the letter? And if the results would be the same, why not just accept my letter?  \"\n",

In short, we began with XXXX, ended up with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and now Specialized Loan Services ( although according to real estate records our home has been foreclosed upon ).

There was no way I \\'d leave my wife and daughter in such a failed and unsafe community that our XXXX neighborhood became.   This year after returning from another XXXX, we learned our property was foreclosed upon around XXXX, and are still being hounded by the debt.

Being careful throughout this whole process about identity theft, I provided no personal info, in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted.

I was faithful to this company for 7 years. We where a small company of less than XXXX employees. We had a shop of XXXX guys and sometimes they would get a check sometimes they would n\\'t. but he kept my paychecks on time. What happened next really surprised me. I was going out of town and return on wednesday. Friday before the weekend he handed me a company check, never does he do that it has always been a direct deposit, so after work around XXXX I deposited the check through ATM. I had US bank as my only bank at the time. Saturday morning i went to the bank and i withdrew {$400.00} dollars and i know it was that amount, because banks wont allow you to withdrawl more for safety reasons. I had {$200.00} in my checking when i made the withdrawl, but because i deposited a night before i was able to take an additional {$200.00}. I did n\\'t want to take more because i had rent to pay that week, so i only wanted to spend what i had in hand. When i get back from my vacation i went to put gas at a gas station and my card was declined, i have no idea why it was declined. I had money in my checking. I tried using it again at the market and again it was declined. so the next day i call my bank and they said my account is closed! they said i commited fraud i did n\\'t understand what i did. They said i should go inside my branch to discuss with the manager so i went in and they told me that the check i deposited bounced and that i withdrew money more then what i had. i explained to them that was a company check and i withdrew because their atm allowed me to take {$200.00} above what i had in my account. So they said they closed all my savings and checking. They put a hold on any money i had in there until they can resolve the issue. The following day i went to the owners bank. XXXX XXXX and explained to manager what happened he said he could n\\'t do much. The owner found out i went to his bank and he really got upset because he said i could of ruined his credit and chances of getting loans. I told him he put me on a black list and it was his fault for bouncing the check he said he was sorry and that he can issue another. That was to late because US bank did n\\'t want to work with me or help me they just shut me down with no phone call or allow me to resolve the issue they just closed all accounts and didnt warn me. I felt betrayed by all parties my employer and my bank. I told US bank that there will be a direct deposit going in that Friday if they can please just take me off the list, they said it was to late they already put it and they could n\\'t do much. I felt that was wrong because not once did they call me to resolve this or give me the chance to fix it. I only found out when i tried to put gas. This has been now years of stress that i can not open any checking account. I have XXXX account and only because my father opened it for me. Its very difficult with only having XXXX bank when they are closed weekends and they are XXXX from me if i ever want to walk inside the branch. I would like US Bank to please take me off this list as it was inaccurate and not fraud.  \"\n",

After going round and round with them, their final result was, we cant help you out right now, try back in a couple years. This short sale we were told was ok, has put a damper on our credit and score over the past couple years and it was all due to 5th3rd \\'s employee assuring us it is ok. My wife and I originally were going to lease the house out until we could sale it for cost.  I would not recommend doing any banking with 5th3rd at all. everything they have told us has done more harm than anything, and we will be paying for it for several more years..  \"\n",

They should have honored the incorrect payoff or they should have deducted what we owed after the flood insurance was cancelled and had up pay that amount so we would not have to wait for a refund. or how about they cut us a break and not charge us interest for the last 11 months. we paid our mortgage up until XXXX XXXX we just could n\\'t afford it anymore we had to pay rent on a place to live. Its been horrible since super storm sandy.  \"\n",

Note, my mtge payment had been deducted from wife \\'s checking account monthly until I, not my wife, declared bankruptcy last XXXX, 2015. - then they stopped making direct withdrawals from her account. I had been instructed to contact their point of contact office and did so several times. They sent me a packet of forms to fill out, including my financials, reasons why I felt that I should be granted a mtge modification and was told to include any documentation relevant to this case. I did so and received a very perfunctory reply from them which you wrote to me that they sent to me/ you? on XXXX, after their underwriting team took a few weeks to consider my request -- namely that I was turned down due to \\\" item # XXXX \\'\\', which, a few pages into their reply, explained that this was due to the fact that my residence was a co-op!  I then decided to file with your agency and have been receiving annoying calls from the bank almost daily. When I speak to a rep, it \\'s always the same thing -- badgering me when/ if I can pay, asking me if I can borrow from a friend or relative, can I liquidate any XXXX I may have, etc., never any discussion about my proposed installment plan.  note, my initial complaint with them was NEVER resolved. I had asked them to forgive the approx {$930.00} they tacked on to my 2 months mtge payments which are in arrears, for legal fees ( {$820.00} ), + late fees and inspection fees for an additional approx {$100.00}, due to the fact that it was THEY who stopped my payments from being received and the fact that XXXX XXXX XXXX, Santander \\'s attny, never got back to me to resolve this issue nor to address my request for an installment payment way back in XXXX of last year, despite both my and my attorney \\'s trying to resolve this issue with her.

All I was requesting was for them to accept my installment plan and to forgive that addtnl {$930.00} they added due to their malfeasance..

THEY HAD JUST LIED IN ORDER TO GET {$380.00} FROM ME. I was very angry at this deception and demanded the {$380.00} back. they refused to give me my money back. wells fargo is truly sleazy bank by the way dont mail anything to the address i give below i dont live there anymore, thanks to wells fargo i went from making {$80000.00} a year to being homeless. its ridiculous how there is no regulation at all of crooked banks like wells fargo  \"\n",
