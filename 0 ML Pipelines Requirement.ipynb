    "In almost all the ML project there are definite steps. These include data validation, data preprocessing, model training, monitoring and deploying. Since ML application developments are inherently different from the typical software application development processes, deveopers tend to do the above mentioned processes manually. And it is super bad because it causes so many problems along the line. Specially when you are comfortable with such manual process. (Telling from experience ðŸ˜ž).\n",

    "Therefore it is important to have proper methods to maintain the ML application development processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, ML application follows a pattern and the managing this ML application development lifecycle is called `ML Ops` or `ML Operations` (like devops). This practice aims at solving problems arise in ML model building process. Below include details about some of the Model life cycle steps."

It may cause problems if inputs are not valid. Therefore, there are number of things to do to during this phase. Checking input value ranges, categorical data type values (do they have new values), is data contain missing values/ additional fields etc are some of such tasks."
